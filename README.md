# hand_gesture_detection---project-based-learning-college-project-
 The hand gestures are one of the typical methods  used in sign language. It is very difficult for the  hearing impaired people to communicate with the  world. This project presents a solution that will not  only automatically recognize the hand gestures but  will also convert it into text and speech output so that  impaired person can easily communicate with  normal people.
